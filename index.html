<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work History</h3>

<p> Back in 2012, I started my first job at a local restaurant, The Red Osier. When I started, I was a dishwasher. Soon after that I was moved to being a busser, cleaning tables for the servers and resetting the tables as well. Up until last year i've worked in the restaurant business completely. i branched away from restaurants when I firsted worked as a DirecTV Sales Reprsentative. I stayed in sales until i came across an auditing position at a local hotel, The Hampton Inn. I spent quite some time behind the front desk, aiding guests for every need. I then decided to pursue a full time job at a plastic factory, Chapin International. Chapin was my most recent job, i stayed at Chapin until i decided to pursue college at GCC.</p>

<p>I currently attend collage at GCC in Batavia, New York. I am pursuing a career in the tech industry. In my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I'm an outgoing individual, who isn't afraid to speak with anyone. In a few brief words, I would discribe myself as a honest, respectable person who is set on bettering myself on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>What I Have To Offer</h3>
<p>Due to the wide variety of jobs I've completed and daily obsticles conquered, i'm a determined student who is more than ready to learn any new information and is willing to step out of any comfort area to better myself and/or any business I'm associated with. </p>
